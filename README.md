# AI-Enhanced REST API on Azure Container Apps
> A production-ready FastAPI service with Azure AI, managed identity, and end-to-end observability.

- **Deploy once** with Azure Developer CLI; Terraform provisions every Azure resource.
- **Develop locally** with the same settings the cloud build uses.
- **Observe everything** via the Managed OpenTelemetry collector and Application Insights.

## At a Glance
- [Deploy to Azure](#deploy-to-azure) â€” create or update an environment with `azd`.
- [Run locally](#local-development) â€” hack on the FastAPI app without touching Azure.
- [Understand the architecture](#architecture) â€” visualize services, identities, and telemetry.
- [Solve the container image chicken-and-egg](#container-image-chicken-and-egg) â€” why the first deploy needs special handling.
- [Tune Terraform inputs](#configuration-cheat-sheet) â€” feature flags and frequently changed variables.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with permission to create Azure Container Apps, Azure AI, Storage, Key Vault, and networking resources.
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) plus `az login` configured.
- [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) 1.6.0 or later.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for local builds and the `azd deploy` container build step.
- Python 3.11 (optional, only for local development) with `pip`.

### Repository Layout (high level)
```

â”œâ”€â”€ azure.yaml                 # azd service definition and deployment hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ infra/                     # Terraform modules (container app, AI, security, networking)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                   # azd hook scripts

â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile                 # Multi-stage build, CPU optimized
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
```

---

## Deploy to Azure
You can run everything from the repository root.

### 1. Authenticate and create/select an environment
```bash
azd auth login
azd env new dev            # or reuse an existing name
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION swedencentral   # choose any Azure region supported by Container Apps
```

### 2. Configure feature flags (optional)
Use `azd env set` to pass Terraform variables or app settings:
```bash
azd env set TF_VAR_enable_private_endpoints false
azd env set TF_VAR_ai_model_set full
azd env set ENABLE_OTEL true                  # turns on FastAPI instrumentation
```
See the [configuration cheat sheet](#configuration-cheat-sheet) for more.

### 3. Provision infrastructure and deploy the app
```bash
azd up
```
`azd up` builds the container image, publishes it to ACR, applies Terraform, and rolls the Container App forward using the post-deploy hook described below.

### 4. Useful follow-up commands
```bash
azd deploy             # re-deploy code without touching infrastructure
azd provision          # re-run Terraform without rebuilding code
azd env get-values     # inspect the current environment settings
azd monitor --overview # jump to Azure Monitor pre-filtered views
```

### 5. Clean up
```bash
azd down               # prompts to delete Azure resources in the environment
```

---

## Local Development
You can iterate locally without touching Azure. The app respects the same environment variables that Terraform injects in the cloud.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Provide the endpoints you want to call; use either real Azure services or local mocks
export ENABLE_OTEL=true
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://<your-openai-endpoint>.openai.azure.com"
export AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT="https://<your-search>.search.windows.net"
export AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX="documents"

python -m uvicorn src.aiapi.server:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Running in Docker
```bash
docker build -t aca-restapi-mcp-otel-openai .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  -e ENABLE_OTEL=true \
  -e AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://<endpoint>" \
  -e AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT="https://<search>.search.windows.net" \
  -e AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX="documents" \

```

Key ideas:
- **Managed identity** removes the need for secrets; the Container App authenticates to Azure OpenAI, Search, Key Vault, and ACR through Entra ID.
- **Managed OpenTelemetry** mirrors traces and logs into Application Insights with no agent maintenance.
- **Azure AI Foundry** lights up end-to-end governance and projects; Terraform can be toggled to use a basic OpenAI account instead.

## Container Image Chicken-and-Egg
Terraform needs a valid container image reference before it can create a revision, but the first `azd provision` runs *before* your image exists in Azure Container Registry. This repo solves the bootstrap loop like this:

1. **Terraform fallback** â€” `infra/container-app.tf` points the Container App to a public sample image (`mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/containerapps-helloworld:latest`) when `var.container_image_revision` is empty. That lets Terraform finish the initial apply.
2. **Build real image** â€” `azd deploy` (invoked during `azd up`) builds your app and pushes it to ACR.
3. **Post-deploy hook** â€” `scripts/postdeploy-update-container-image.sh` copies `SERVICE_API_IMAGE_NAME` into both `CONTAINER_IMAGE_REVISION` and `TF_VAR_container_image_revision` environment values.
4. **Subsequent runs** â€” Terraform now sees a concrete ACR digest/tag, enabling the Container App to reference your private image while still logging in with the managed identity.

You never have to edit Terraform filesâ€”just let the hook manage the revision variables.

## Configuration Cheat Sheet
Most configuration flows through `azd env set`. Key settings:

| Purpose | Environment key | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Azure region | `AZURE_LOCATION` | Controls where resources are created. |
| Toggle private endpoints | `TF_VAR_enable_private_endpoints` | Requires Premium SKU registry (already default). Set `true` for private networking. |
| Deploy GPT-4o only vs + mini | `TF_VAR_ai_model_set` | `minimal` or `full` (default). |
| Disable AI Foundry | `TF_VAR_enable_ai_foundry` | Set `false` to keep only a Cognitive Services OpenAI account. |
| Turn on Container Apps auth | `TF_VAR_enable_container_app_auth` | Enabled by default; disables if set to `false`. |
| Force internal-only ingress | `TF_VAR_container_app_public` | Set `false` for private endpoints and no public URL. |
| Enable managed OTEL agent | `TF_VAR_enable_container_apps_managed_otel` | When `true`, enables traces/logs to Application Insights automatically. |
| Force app OTEL instrumentation | `ENABLE_OTEL` | App-side toggle. When `true`, FastAPI + Requests instrumentation is enabled. |

All other Terraform variables are documented inline in `infra/variables.tf`. You can also keep per-environment settings in `.azure/<env>/.env`.

---

## Observability & Telemetry
- **Managed Agent path**: Enable `TF_VAR_enable_container_apps_managed_otel=true`. Container Apps streams traces and logs into Application Insights using the connection string provisioned by Terraform.
- **Manual OTLP path**: Leave the feature disabled; the app will fall back to OTLP gRPC export using `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` variables (ACA injects defaults automatically).
- **Instrumentation control**: Set `ENABLE_OTEL=true` to wire FastAPI + outbound request tracing; leave unset for minimal overhead.
- **Dashboards**: Use `azd monitor --overview` to jump directly into the curated Azure Monitor workbook for your Container App.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips
- `azd up` fails before Terraform? Run `azd provision` to surface IaC errors, then `azd deploy` once resolved.
- Container App stuck on the sample image? Ensure the post-deploy hook ran and that `CONTAINER_IMAGE_REVISION` has a value (`azd env get-value CONTAINER_IMAGE_REVISION`).
- Managed identity permission issues? Rerun `azd provision`â€”Terraform manages all role assignments.
- Need to inspect Terraform state locally? `cd infra && terraform plan -out plan.tfplan` (uses the azd-generated environment variables).

## Contributing
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/awesome-thing`.
2. Run `azd up` (or `azd deploy`) against your sandbox environment to validate.
3. Add tests or scripts if you introduce new functionality.
4. Open a pull request describing the change, pipeline impact, and testing.
