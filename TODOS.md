### Container Platform
- [x] Configure Azure Container Apps Environment with Log Analytics integration
- [x] Configure Container Apps with auto-scaling (0-1 instances)
- [x] Set up environment variables for AI Foundry and AI Services endpoints
- [x] Configure User-Assigned Managed Identity authentication for container apps
- [x] Set up HTTP scaling rules and health probes
- [x] Implement idle scaling for cost optimization (scale to 0 instances)

### Monitoring & Observability
- [x] Configure Application Insights for the Container Apps
- [x] Set up OpenTelemetry agent configuration

### Application Development
- [x] Implement FastAPI application structure
- [x] Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- [x] Implement Azure AI Foundry integration (updated from standalone OpenAI)
- [x] Add Azure AI Search integration
- [x] Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [x] Implement error handling and logging
- [x] Create requirements.txt with latest 2025 dependencies
- [x] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [x] Create .env.example for configuration

### Security Implementation
- [ ] Implement API authentication and authorization
- [ ] Configure Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- [ ] Set up audit logging and compliance monitoring
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Configure backup and disaster recovery

### Performance Tuning
- [ ] Configure caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize AI model calls and token usage
- [ ] Implement request throttling and rate limiting
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Optimize container resource allocation

### Documentation & Operations
- [x] Create API documentation and usage guides

- [x] Create Azure AI Search Terraform documentation (docs/azure-ai-search-terraform.md)
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Set up user training materials
- [ ] Document cost optimization strategies

## Next Priority Tasks

### High Priority (Deployment Blockers)
1. **Container Image Deployment**: Build and push application image to ACR
2. **Document Indexing**: Upload and index 10k HTML documents in AI Search
3. **API Authentication**: Implement authentication and authorization

### Medium Priority (Production Readiness)
1. **Custom Monitoring**: Set up dashboards and alerting rules
2. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and rate limiting
3. **Security Hardening**: Network security groups and audit logging

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment workflows
2. **DataDog Integration**: External monitoring platform
3. **Advanced Features**: Blue-green deployments, staging environments

## Notes

- **AI Foundry Transformation**: Successfully migrated from standalone Azure OpenAI to Azure AI Foundry Hub + AI Services architecture
- **Managed Identity**: All services configured for passwordless authentication
- **Cost Optimization**: Container Apps scale to 0 for idle cost savings
- **Private Endpoints**: Optional secure networking ready for production use
